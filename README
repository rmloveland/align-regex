ALIGN-REGEX
===========

Align lines of text from standard input based on a regular expression.

For example, given

    name = 'Rich'
    hometown = 'Somewhere, NY'
    age = 37

after running `align-regex =`, it will appear as:

    name     = 'Rich'
    hometown = 'Somewhere, NY'
    age      = 37

Another example:

    say 'Hello' if ($val > 10);
    19 if exposed($feature);

After running `align-regex if`:

    say 'Hello' if ($val > 10);
    19          if exposed($feature);
